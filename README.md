# Battleship Game

A console application for a state tracker for a single-player **Battleship game**, based on the [classic game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)).

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `BattleshipGame.sln` on Visual Studio
3. Build the solution in `debug` or `release` mode
4. Open the console
5. **Play the game** ;) The instructions will be loaded as soon as the build succeeds.

## How to Play

The console app closely follows the rules of Battleship -- the objective of the game is to sink the all ships. 
- In this version, you need to sink only the Battleship. 
- Here, the user will play against the "computer" as it randomly places the battleship (size 4) on the board. 
- Call out shots until you sink the ship. The board will be printed as you enter the "coordinates"
